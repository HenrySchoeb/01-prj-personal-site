<section class="bio">
<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I'm a sophomore Computer Engineering student at Michigan State University with a strong interest in web development. Beyond coding, I'm aspiring to work in the field of orthotics and prosthetics, where I hope to combine my technical background with healthcare innovation. This portfolio highlights my journey and the projects I create along the way.</p>

<h3>OpenGloves VR Haptic Force Feedback Glove</h3>
<p>This project is based on the OpenGloves firmware and uses an ESP32 microcontroller to read potentiometers attached to each finger. Each potentiometer is connected with a spring-spooled string, allowing measurement of finger extension, which is then mapped into the virtual world. Servo motors are used to restrict potentiometer movement, simulating the sensation of touch and making it feel as though you're physically holding the virtual objects you see.</p>

<h3>Robotic Arm</h3>
<p>This project is inspired by robotic arms used in manufacturing automation. A 1/6 scale controller model is used with potentiometers to read its positioning, and high-torque servos replicate those movements on the robotic arm itself. It runs on Arduino IDE firmware and features a 3D printed shell for structure and design.</p>
